# my-docker-files

My custom docker configurations for various examples projects. Example projects are added to focused subject folder.

## Notes

- These examples mostly `.env` file based but `.env` files can be vulnerability. Because environment variables is not encrypted. So, you should use **[Docker Secrets](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/secrets/)** in production.
